Day 2: GitHub Pages and Documentation and Introduction to 3D Printing

The second day of the course was about getting along with GitHub and detailed page developement process. After the session, the class was split into two groups, after which we learnt in detail about 3D Printing. Both the mechanical and designing sides of 3D Printing was explained in detail by the supporting staff.

Daily Assignments:

Develope a desccriptive page in GitHub
Upload the daily progress on the class
Install Cura Software
Install any of the mentioned creative designing softwares: Autodesk AutoCAD/SketchUp/Rhinoceros 3D/Catia/CorelDraw/Eagle/SolidWorks
All assignments were completed on time. Among the designing software list, Autodesk AutoCAD and Rhinoceros 3D were chosen for installation.

Day 3: 3D Printing and Desinging Basics

On the third day, we learnt the basics about designing in Rhinoceros 3D and conversion of the design file to .stl format to print using the 3D printer. A brief explaination about the 3D printing was also given. After the session about the basics, the students were asked to design a simple 1cm x 1cm x 1cm block to be printed using the Ultimaker 2+ 3D Printer.

Daily Assignments:

Project: Ideate the design of any daily use product to be built using the 3D printer or any CNC machine
All assignments were completed on time. The basic prototype designed and printed can be viewed here.

Day 4: Laser Cutting and Vinyl Printing

The day commenced with the introduction and basic explaination about the CNC Laser Cutter and Vinyl Printer. The working and basic operation of both the machines were explained and assignments were given to familiarize the students with the machines. The softwares used for giving design input to both the machines were also explained.

Daily Assignments:

Design and cut any daily use product model using laser cutter
Design and cut any text or design on vinyl sheet using the vinyl cutter

All assignments were completed on time.

Day 5: Printer and Cutter Assignments

The full day was dedicated for clarifying the doubts on the previous classes and practical side of designing, also to perform a simple assignment on creating any daily use objects using the 3D Printer, Laser Cutter and the Vinyl Printer.

Daily Assignments:

Project: Ideate the design of any daily use product to be cut and built using the Laser Cutter CNC machine
Project: Ideate the design of any daily use product to be built using the 3D printer
Project: Ideate the design of any daily use product to be cut and pasted using the Vinyl Printer CNC machine
All assignments were completed on time.

Day 6: Electronics, PCB Milling, Moulding and Casting

The final day commenced with a brief session on electronics printing and tutorial on Autodesk Eagle. Basic working and tutorials on how to design an electronics circuit on PCB using Autodesk Eagle was given. Later that day, every student made their own dedsigned circuit that was then milled on a pcb using the ShopBot CNC machine. Due to time lag, soldering the PCB was presented theoretically.

In between the design of circuit, a brief introduction was given about Moulding and Casting any prototype using acrylic rubber as the material. A demonstration was also given by moulding andcasting a ring using the moulds printed by the Ultimaker 2+ 3D printer. The cast made using rubber was taken out 4 hours after moulding.

Daily Assignments:

Design a circuit using Autodesk Eagle
Create a PCB milled using ShopBot CNC machine
Mould and Cast any structure
Screen print words on a T-Shirt
All assignments where completed on time.
